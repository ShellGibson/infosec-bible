## Sparrow 
### Author: CISA
Sparrow.ps1 was created by CISA's Cloud Forensics team to help detect possible compromised accounts and applications in the Azure/m365 environment. The tool is intended for use by incident responders, and focuses on the narrow scope of user and application activity endemic to identity and authentication based attacks seen recently in multiple sectors. It is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive of available data, and is intended to narrow a larger set of available investigation modules and telemetry to those specific to recent attacks on federated identity sources and applications.
